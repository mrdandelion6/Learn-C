# Learn to Code

Welcome to my code learning repository. This repository is a collection of my notes and code snippets as I embark on the journey of learning many different programming languages and coding concepts.


## Notes I've Made
My notes are split into 2 categories: **languages** and **topics**.

## Languages
Here are notes I've made on various programming languages. Most of them are ongoing and I have yet to complete them. There are also a few I want to start making notes for later on as well.
### Doing (🚧) / Done (🏁)
- 🏁 `C` and systems programming, pipes, processes, and sockets. made for CSC209H5.
- 🏁 `JavaScript` and DOM
- 🏁 `Bash` (not in depth)
- 🚧 `C++` 
- 🚧 `Rust` 
- 🚧 `Python` (only has notes on advanced tricks and using Jupyter).
- 🚧 `SQL`
- 🚧 `Scala`
- 🚧 `x86`
- 🚧 `R` (probably not gonna finish this)
- 🚧 `PHP`
- 🚧 `Go` (not doing this any time soon)

### To Start
- CUDA (know it already)
- HIP (to learn)
- MATLAB (know it already)
- TypeScript (know it already)
- React (know it already)
- Express (know it already)
- Sass (know it already)
- Fortran (to learn)

## Topics
I have made quite a few notes on important computer science topics as well.
### Doing (🚧) / Done (🏁)
- 🏁 `Data Science`
- 🚧 `Data Structures` (made for CSC236)
- 🚧 `Cyber Security ` (made for CSC347)
- 🚧 `Operating Systems` (made for CSC369)
- 🚧 `Parallel Programming` (made for CSC367)
- 🚧 `HTTP`
- 🚧 `Machine Learning`
- 🚧 `Leetcoding` (will always be ongoing)
- 🏁 `Using VS Code`
- 🚧 `Git`


#### Happy coding.
