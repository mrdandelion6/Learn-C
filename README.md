# Learn C and Shell Script!

Welcome to my C and shell script learning repository! ðŸš€ This repository is a collection of my notes and code snippets as I embark on the journey of learning C and shell scripting.

## Contents
- `notes.c`: Dive into my detailed notes on various C concepts.
- `notes.sh`: Dive into my detailed notes on various shell scripting concepts.
- `main.c`, `myscript.sh`: These files were created for testing purposes during my learning process and may not be particularly useful.

Feel free to clone the repository and experiment with the code. If you have any suggestions or find areas for improvement, don't hesitate to open an issue or pull request.

Happy coding.
