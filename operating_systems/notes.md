# OS notes

## What is an operating system ?

a very low layer of software that manages hardware resources and provides a set of services for application software. in other words, a very convennient abstract for hardware access.

they also provided restricted access to hardware resources like disks etc.

in older days, there was no OS. this worked because the hardware was very simple but nowadays it's very unfeasible because of the complexity of hardware.

### Main goals of an operating system
- **PRIMARY REASON: convenience** - make the computer easier to use
- **SECONDARY REASON: efficiency** - make the computer run faster
  - note that you have limited resources, you need something to manage which process gets what resources and when

these two goals can often conflict with each other. for example, a more secure system might be less convenient to use.

### Roles of an OS
- **being a virtual machine**: extends and simplifices interface to physical hardware as mentioned before. also provides a library of functions accessible through an API.
  
- **resource manager**: manages resources like CPU, memory, disk, etc. provides an environment 

- **system controller**: controls the execution of programs, and prevents errors and improper use of the computer. protects against unauthorized access.


### Main components of an operating system
- memory management
- synchronization
- inter-process communication
- scheduling
- exception handling
- file system management
- device drivers
- networking
