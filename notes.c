// C Notes

// std stands for standard library, io for the input/output, and .h to signify header code
#include "functions.h" // for sharing functions
#include <stdio.h> // for scanf and printf
#include <stdbool.h> // for using bool types


// C source code has an entry point just like Java, which is the main() method.
// note at the top we have #include statements. this is needed for C for using several (common) methods, types, etc.
int main() {

    // in C, even for functions, we must declare the function signatures ahead of time
    int takeInput();
    int average_temp();

    averageTemp();
    return 0;
}

int takeInput() {
    double num1, num2;

    scanf("%lf %lf", &num1, &num2);
    printf("You typed %f and %f\n", num1, num2);

// === IMPORTING FUNCTIONS ===
// to import functions from one c file to another must create a header file, for example functions.h
// inside the header file, have the following

#ifndef FUNCTIONS_H // starting place
#define FUNCTIONS_H

int takeInput(); // functions to make accessible between files
int averageTemp();

#endif // closing place


// === ARRAYS ===
