    # 'data.frame':	100 obs. of  11 variables:
    # $ participant_id: chr  "par_062" "par_006" "par_066" "par_042" ...
    # $ group         : chr  "patient" "control" "control" "patient" ...

    # we get a mix of chr (string) and int data.

    # CLEANING CSVs
    # dirty work to get data in the right format to be analyzed

    # we never change the original data set, we only want to change the data loaded in R, our df

    # we can access variables from a data frame using the $ operator. for example
    df$sex

    # AUTOMATIC ITERATION
    # note that when we do some operator on a variable from a data frame it automatically iterates over all values in that variable.
    # think of each variable of a dataframe as a column, and each cell in that column as a value. we refer to the stuff in variables just as "values".
    # so when we do something like df$sex == 'M' like this:
    df$sex == 'M'
    # it iterates over all the values in the sex variable and prints TRUE or FALSE for all of them. and we get this:
    # [1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE
    # [25] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
    # [49]  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE
    # [73]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE
    # [97] FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE

    # REPLACING VALUES
    # we note there is one missing value "". this was supposed to be M.
    # here is a reckless approach to fix this:
    df$sex[df$sex == ''] <- 'M'
    # we index into df$sex, and our index value is anywhere where df$sex == ''. 
    # this is dangerous because it will just turn everything into that's '' into 'M', even if its some other missing data

    # a better way to do it is by using the participant_id variable as these are unique
    df$participant_id
    # we know the missing M value has a participant_id of par_018 so we do this
    df$sex[df$participant_id == "par_018"] <- 'M'

    # DELETING VALUES
    # to delete values from a df, we just set it to NA, which is like NULL.
    # note that we have one extremely large value in df$age. suppose we only want participants to be aged 20-50.
    df$age[df$age < 20 | df$age > 50] # just prints 388

    # we set it to NA
    df$age[df$age < 20 | df$age > 50] <- NA
    # note the OR operator is just one |, like a bitwise operator in C or Java

    # now we move on to checking the cog_score variable. we note there's a NaN value.
    # we don't want to keep NaN in our cog_score because the cog_scores are indeed numbers!
    # we want missing values to be NA, because if it's NaN we might end up getting some errors later on when trying to do numeric calculations with stuff in cog_score

    # we have a special function to check if a value is a NaN, using is_nan(x)
    # we can also use sum() function to sum up all the TRUEs that are returned. so we can see how many values in a variable are NaN like this:
    sum(is.nan(df$cog_score))

    df$cog_score[is.nan(df$cog_score)] <- NA
    # we just check if something in cog_score is NAN and if it is set it to NA

    # BOX PLOTS
    # can make a box plot of our data frame as follows:
    boxplot(df$brain_score)
    # we observe that our box plot has a major outlier.
    # even tho this outlier may be a real data point, we likely want to ignore it to avoid a bias in data analysis.

    # we can also do boxplot.stats to see all the stats of the boxplot
    boxplot.stats(df$brain_score)
    # $stats
    # [1] 73.590 82.800 85.585 89.405 96.110

    # $n
    # [1] 100

    # $conf
    # [1] 84.54141 86.62859

    # $out
    # [1]   0.00  71.57  72.09 998.70

    # note that boxplot.stats() returns a list type object. side note, we can check the type of object a variable is using str()
    # str stands for structure not string
    test <- boxplot.stats(df$brain_score)
    str(test) # prints List of 4

    # we can exclude everything from the outliers variable when making our boxplot
    boxplot( df$brain_score[!df$brain_score %in% boxplot.stats(df$brain_score)$out] )
    # now we have no more outliers
    
    # TODO: finish this note
    # supposed we want to create a new variable in our data frame that contains 
    df$test_total <- rowSums(df[c('test_1', 'test_2', 'test_3')], na.rm = FALSE)

    # EXCLUDING ENTIRE ROWS
    # note that each row in a df is like one element in our data set that has values in each variable.
    # we may want to remove entire rows of data for many reasons. for example, par_036 recinded their consent and all their test values are 0.
    df <- df[!df$participant_id == 'par_036'] # this removes the entire row for par_036

    # lets keep track of all our missing values
    missing_indices <- which(is.na(df), arr.ind = TRUE)
    # the value for missing_indices is:
    #      row col
    # [1,]  86   3
    # [2,]  59   6
    # [3,]  78   6
    # [4,]  18  10

    # CREATING DFs
    # here is an example of creating a df for the missing contents of our original data
    missing_df <- data.frame(
        participant_id = df$participant_id[missing_indices]
        missing_variables = names(df)$[missing_indices]
    )
}
