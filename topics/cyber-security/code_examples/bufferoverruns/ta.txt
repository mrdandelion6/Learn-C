Lionel,
Please see the week 02 tutorial under

        http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~arnold/347/08f/index.html

Your job: Supervise them as they work on the exercises. You should offer  
advice. DO NOT SOLVE THEM FOR STUDENTS. These exercises will be part of
their first assignment. As well, the important point is for them to 
understand the tools as well as to understand how the buffer overrun 
actually happens.

If you like, you can list the tools they need to solve the problems...
your job is to answer questions. Feel free to work through question 1.

By the way, we started to smash the stack. We covered...

I have modified the tutorial, please see the week 2 tutorial

and the solution to question 1 at...

        http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~arnold/347/08f/tutorials/bufferoverruns/stackSolution.c

we actually went over this in class. You might want to go over 1 with them, walk them through, gcc,
gdb, info registers, print &hacked etc. Please send questions!! Let me know if you want me to walk you
through all of this on the phone (or in person).

By the way, all of this takes place on the RH7.2 vm. Finally, the addresses will necessarily be off a
bit. the offset (44) should not be. That is, don't be surprised if the addresses on your stack are
shifted from those on mine. You can walk them through 1, but let them work on 2 and 3 (with your
help). These may appear on their first assignment.

Send questions!!
