# what is git?

git is a version control system. it allows you to track changes to files over time. it is used to coordinate work between multiple people.

imagine you want to write a book with a friend. you could email each other the book back and forth, but that would be a mess. instead, you could use git to keep track of the changes you make to the book. you could each work on your own copy of the book, and then use git to merge your changes together.

## git vs github

git is a version control system. github is a website that hosts git repositories.
