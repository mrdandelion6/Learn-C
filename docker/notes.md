# Learn Docker

Welcome to my Docker notes. 

Docker is a platform to develop, ship, and run applications in "containers." 

## What is a container?

A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

So things across different machines are consistent with containers!

## How does Docker work?
Docker uses a client-server architecture. The Docker client talks to the Docker daemon, which does the heavy lifting of building, running, and distributing your Docker containers.

## Dockerfile
To use docker, you need to create a Dockerfile. This file contains instructions on how to build the image.
