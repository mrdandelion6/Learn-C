# Learn Docker

Welcome to my Docker notes. 

Docker is a platform to develop, ship, and run applications in "containers." 

## What is a container?

A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

So things across different machines are consistent with containers!
