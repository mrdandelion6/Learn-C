    "A Jupyter notebook consists of cells. These cells can be code cells, markdown cells, or raw cells. In Jupyter, you can either be in command mode or editing mode. Command mode is for navigating cells and edit mode is for editing individual cells.\n",

    "You can run a code cell while being in command mode and pressing *shift + enter* or pressing the *Run* button. The output will be displayed below the cell. Code cells can output text, plots, or other media types. This is why Jupyter is so nice for data analysis.\n",
